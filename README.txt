 - Implementation of splashscreen, main menu, loading screen and pause menu for a full game experience.
 - HUD implementation that shows a counter with how many points you have gotten by destroying other planes and a minimap which operates in real time showing you the position and distance of the enemies.
 - Fully implemented bullet manager that lets you have different shooting modes and bullets.
 - Different types of enemies: it has a little one (weaker) and a big one (stronger, with more life).
 - Application of rendering optimisations: it renders the elements based on frustum culling.
 - There are lots of shaders present in the game (player, environment, bullet...)
 - Implementation of audio to make a full immersive experience: different music in the menu than in-game and shooting and explosions sound effects.
